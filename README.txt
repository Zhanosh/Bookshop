Online bookstore written with Python and JavaScript

 Here we have a site that has a beautiful html and css template, 
of course, the template is ready and used for free, but I made 
some changes inside it to make it more beautiful and complete, 
because this template did not have pages like login, userpanel 
and other things, and it caused To start working on its design.
Also, we have a relatively great backend, which I tried my best to be dynamic
I developed database models using Django and completely covered the backend using it.
In this project, I used javascript and jquery framework to display some simple messages and change the shopping cart.Well, sqlite3 database is used for data storage, which is a small database, but it starts our work, and it is Django's default database.

I will soon write the apis of my site so that the api can be used, and I am also trying to provide the ability to send sms when logging in so that we have a more complete site. I hope I can add these features to the project as soon as possible.

I hope you can make the most of the project and that it can help you
